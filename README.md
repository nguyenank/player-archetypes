# Women's Hockey Player Archetypes

![screenshot of web app](/resources/preview.png)

This is a [web application](https://player-archetypes.netlify.app/) version of the player cards originally created by Carleen Markey and Nayan Patel. The original data, full results, and paper are also available on [Github](https://github.com/cmarkey/Player-Clustering).

This web app was built using D3.js, drawing from this [radar chart code](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242) by Nadieh Bremer.
